Wordpress with Bedrock and Sage wordpress start theme
# What is Bedrock?
-Bedrock is a WordPress boilerplate.
-WordPress boilerplate with Composer, easier configuration, and an improved folder structure
1) Why use Bedrock?
Better folder structure
Dependency management with Composer
Easy WordPress configuration with environment specific files
Environment variables with Dotenv
Autoloader for mu-plugins (use regular plugins as mu-plugins)
Enhanced security (separated web root and secure passwords with wp-password-bcrypt)

2)Requirements
PHP >= 8.1

3)Installing Bedrock with Composer
Create a new Bedrock project:
$ composer create-project roots/bedrock


4)Add theme(s) in web/app/themes/ as you would for a normal WordPress site
5)Set the document root on your webserver to Bedrock's web folder: /path/to/site/web/
6)Access WordPress admin at https://example.com/wp/wp-admin/

7)# Multisite
Bedrock is multisite network compatible, but needs the roots/multisite-url-fixer mu-plugin on subdomain installs to make sure admin URLs function properly. This plugin is not needed on subdirectory installs but will work well with them. From your Bedrock directory:

$ composer require roots/multisite-url-fixer



1) What is Sage?
Sage is a WordPress starter theme.

2) Why use Sage?
Harness the power of Laravel and its available packages thanks to Acorn.
Clean, efficient theme templating utilizing Laravel Blade.
Lightning fast frontend development workflow powered by Bud.
Out of the box support for Tailwind CSS.

3) Getting Started
Windows users

WSL is required in order to use Sage. Build commands must be ran from a WSL environment.

Sage relies on Node.js based tools to manage dependencies and build assets. We recommend using Volta to install and manage Node.js. We also recommend using Yarn. After installing Volta:

# Install the latest Node.js LTS release
$ volta install node

# Globally install Yarn
$ npm install --global yarn


# Installing Acorn
Sage requires Acorn but doesn't ship with it included. This is to give you the flexibility to include it in a way that works best for your environment. There's a few different ways to install Acorn.

See the Acorn installation docs for additional details.
composer require roots/acorn
# Installing Sage with Composer
Install Sage using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace your-theme-name below with the name of your theme):

# From your WordPress themes directory, run:
$ composer create-project roots/sage your-theme-name
To install the latest development version of Sage, add dev-main to the end of the command:

$ composer create-project roots/sage your-theme-name dev-main


# Build assets
You must build theme assets in order to access your site. Failing to build the assets will result in the error:

The manifest [/path/to/sage/public/manifest.json] cannot be found.
# Running the first build
Run yarn from the theme directory to install dependencies
Update bud.config.js with your local dev URL
yarn build â€” Compile assets
